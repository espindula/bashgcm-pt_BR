The file ``bash.1'' from source tree was transformed into HTML via GNU 
groff [roff2html in groffer 1.1.2 of 26 Jan 2011 (Perl version)]:

$ roff2html /home/jamenson/bash/doc/bash.1 > bashgcm-en_US.html


After, ``bashgcm-en_US.html'' was salved in plain text ASCII via Lynx 
text web browser [Lynx Version 2.8.8rel.2 (09 Mar 2014)]:

$ lynx bashgcm-en_US.html

Now, we have a good initial file to work on.
